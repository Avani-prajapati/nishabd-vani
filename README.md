**NishabdVaani Web** - *Empowering Silent Dreams*

## Project Overview  

**NishabdVaani Web** is a learning platform designed specifically for Deaf and mute students. It provides a seamless user interface to learn, practice, and track progress. The web platform complements the NishabdVaani app, ensuring accessibility across devices and environments.  

It is developed using modern web technologies such as **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, with a focus on responsiveness, performance, and user experience. The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, while AI-based features leverage **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **MediaPipe** for real-time interaction.
